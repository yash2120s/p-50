            A Guide to Origami Paper Folding  
          </p>
          <h3>Origami is the art of paper folding, which is often associated with Japanese culture. 
              In Japanese, "ori" means folding and "gami" means paper. 
              In modern usage, the word "origami" is used as an inclusive term for all folding practices, 
              regardless of their culture of origin.
